.TH VSFTPD.CONF 5
.SH NAME
vsftpd.conf, the config file for vsftpd
.SH DESCRIPTION
vsftpd.conf may be used to control various aspects of vsftpd's behaviour. By
default, vsftpd looks for this file at the location
.BR /etc/vsftpd.conf .
However, you may override this by specifying a command line argument to
vsftpd. The command line argument is the pathname of the configuration file
for vsftpd. This behaviour is useful because you may wish to use an advanced
inetd such as
.BR xinetd
to launch vsftpd with different configuration files on a per virtual host
basis.

.SH FORMAT
The format of vsftpd.conf is very simple. Each line is either a comment or
a directive. Comment lines start with a # and are ignored. A directive line
has the format:

option=value

It is important to note that it is an error to put any space between the
option, = and value.

Each setting has a compiled in default which may be modified in the
configuration file.

.SH BOOLEAN OPTIONS
Below is a list of boolean options. The value for a boolean option may be set
to
.BR YES
or
.BR NO .

.TP
.B anon_mkdir_write_enable
If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to create new directories
under certain conditions. For this to work, the option
.BR write_enable
must be activated, and the anonymous ftp user must have write permission on
the parent directory.

Default: NO
.TP
.B anon_other_write_enable
If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to perform write operations
other than upload and create directory, such as deletion and renaming. This
is generally not recommended but included for completeness.

Default: NO
.TP
.B anon_upload_enable
If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to upload files under certain
conditions. For this to work, the option
.BR write_enable
must be activated, and the anonymous ftp user must have write permission on
desired upload locations.

Default: NO
.TP
.B anon_world_readable_only
When enabled, anonymous users will only be allowed to download files which
are world readable. This is recognising that the ftp user may own files,
especially in the presence of uploads.

Default: YES
.TP
.B anonymous_enable
Controls whether anonymous logins are permitted or not. If enabled,
both the usernames
.BR ftp
and
.BR anonymous
are recognised as anonymous logins.

Default: YES
.TP
.B ascii_download_enable
When enabled, ASCII mode data transfers will be honoured on downloads.

Default: NO
.TP
.B ascii_upload_enable
When enabled, ASCII mode data transfers will be honoured on uploads.

Default: NO
.TP
.B async_abor_enable
When enabled, a special FTP command known as "async ABOR" will be enabled.
Only ill advised FTP clients will use this feature. Addtionally, this feature
is awkward to handle, so it is disabled by default. Unfortunately, some FTP
clients will hang when cancelling a transfer unless this feature is available,
so you may wish to enable it.

Default: NO
.TP
.B check_shell
Note! This option only has an effect for non-PAM builds of vsftpd. If disabled,
vsftpd will not check /etc/shells for a valid user shell for local logins.

Default: YES
.TP
.B chown_uploads
If enabled, all anonymously uploaded files will have the ownership changed
to the user specified in the setting
.BR chown_username .
This is useful from an administrative, and perhaps security, standpoint.

Default: NO
.TP
.B chroot_list_enable
If activated, you may provide a list of local users who are placed in a
chroot() jail in their home directory upon login. The meaning is slightly
different if chroot_local_user is set to YES. In this case, the list becomes
a list of users which are NOT to be placed in a chroot() jail.
By default, the file containing this list is
/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list, but you may override this with the
.BR chroot_list_file
setting.

Default: NO
.TP
.B chroot_local_user
If set to YES, local users will be placed in a chroot() jail in their home
directory after login.
.BR Warning:
This option has security implications, especially if the users have upload
permission, or shell access. Only enable if you know what you are doing.
Note that these security implications are not vsftpd specific. They apply to
all FTP daemons which offer to put local users in chroot() jails.

Default: NO
.TP
.B connect_from_port_20
This controls whether PORT style data connections use port 20 (ftp-data) on
the server machine. For security reasons, some clients may insist that this
is the case. Conversely, disabling this option enables vsftpd to run with
slightly less privilege.

Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)
.TP
.B deny_email_enable
If activated, you may provide a list of anonymous password e-mail responses
which cause login to be denied. By default, the file containing this list is
/etc/vsftpd.banned_emails, but you may override this with the
.BR banned_email_file
setting.

Default: NO
.TP
.B dirmessage_enable
If enabled, users of the FTP server can be shown messages when they first
enter a new directory. By default, a directory is scanned for the
file .message, but that may be overridden with the configuration setting
.BR message_file .

Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)
.TP
.B guest_enable
If enabled, all non-anonymous logins are classed as "guest" logins. A guest
login is remapped to the user specified in the
.BR guest_username
setting.

Default: NO
.TP
.B hide_ids
If enabled, all user and group information in directory listings will be
displayed as "ftp".

Default: NO
.TP
.B listen
If enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. This means that vsftpd must
not be run from an inetd of some kind. Instead, the vsftpd executable is
run once directly. vsftpd itself will then take care of listening for and
handling incoming connections.

Default: NO
.TP
.B local_enable
Controls whether local logins are permitted or not. If enabled, normal
user accounts in /etc/passwd may be used to log in.

Default: NO
.TP
.B log_ftp_protocol
When enabled, all FTP requests and responses are logged, providing the option
xferlog_std_format is not enabled. Useful for debugging.

Default: NO
.TP
.B ls_recurse_enable
When enabled, this setting will allow the use of "ls -R". This is a minor
security risk, because a ls -R at the top level of a large site may consume
a lot of resources.

Default: NO
.TP
.B no_anon_password
When enabled, this prevents vsftpd from asking for an anonymous password -
the anonymous user will log straight in.

Default: NO
.TP
.B one_process_model
If you have a Linux 2.4 kernel, it is possible to use a different security
model which only uses one process per connection. It is a less pure security
model, but gains you performance. You really don't want to enable this unless
you know what you are doing, and your site supports huge numbers of
simultaneously connected users.

Default: NO
.TP
.B passwd_chroot_enable
If enabled, along with
.BR chroot_local_user
, then a chroot() jail location may be specified on a per-user basis. Each
user's jail is derived from their home directory string in /etc/passwd. The
occurence of /./ in the home directory string denotes that the jail is at that
particular location in the path.

Default: NO
.TP
.B pasv_enable
Set to NO if you want to disallow the PASV method of obtaining a data
connection.

Default: YES
.TP
.B pasv_promiscuous
Set to YES if you want to disable the PASV security check that ensures the
data connection originates from the same IP address as the control connection.
Only enable if you know what you are doing! The only legitimate use for this
is in some form of secure tunnelling scheme.

Default: NO
.TP
.B port_enable
Set to NO if you want to disallow the PORT method of obtaining a data
connection.

Default: YES
.TP
.B port_promiscuous
Set to YES if you want to disable the PORT security check that ensures that
outgoing data connections can only connect to the client. Only enable if
you know what you are doing!

Default: NO
.TP
.B setproctitle_enable
If enabled, vsftpd will try and show session status information in the system
process listing. In other words, the reported name of the process will change
to reflect what a vsftpd session is doing (idle, downloading etc). You
probably want to leave this off for security purposes.

Default: NO
.TP
.B tcp_wrappers
If enabled, and vsftpd was compiled with tcp_wrappers support, incoming
connections will be fed through tcp_wrappers access control. Furthermore,
there is a mechanism for per-IP based configuration. If tcp_wrappers sets
the VSFTPD_LOAD_CONF environment variable, then the vsftpd session will try
and load the vsftpd configuration file specified in this variable. 

Default: NO
.TP
.B text_userdb_names
By default, numeric IDs are shown in the user and group fields of directory
listings. You can get textual names by enabling this parameter. It is off
by default for performance reasons.

Default: NO
.TP
.B use_localtime
If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the the time in your
local time zone. The default is to display GMT. The times returned by the
MDTM FTP command are also affected by this option.

Default: NO
.TP
.B use_sendfile
An internal setting used for testing the relative benefit of using the
sendfile() system call on your platform.

Default: YES
.TP
.B userlist_deny
This option is examined if
.B userlist_enable
is activated. If you set this setting to NO, then users will be denied login
unless they are explicitly listed in the file specified by
.BR userlist_file .
When login is denied, the denial is issued before the user is asked for a
password.

Default: YES
.TP
.B userlist_enable
If enabled, vsftpd will load a list of usernames, from the filename given by
.BR userlist_file .
If a user tries to log in using a name in this file, they will be denied
before they are asked for a password. This may be useful in preventing
cleartext passwords being transmitted. See also
.BR userlist_deny .

Default: NO
.TP
.B write_enable
This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are allowed
or not. These commands are: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE and SITE.

Default: NO
.TP
.B xferlog_enable
If enabled, a log file will be maintained detailling uploads and downloads.
By default, this file will be placed at /var/log/vsftpd.log, but this location
may be overridden using the configuration setting
.BR xferlog_file .

Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)
.TP
.B xferlog_std_format
If enabled, the transfer log file will be written in standard xferlog format,
as used by wu-ftpd. This is useful because you can reuse existing transfer
statistics generators. The default format is more readable, however.

Default: NO

.SH NUMERIC OPTIONS
Below is a list of numeric options. A numeric option must be set to a non
negative integer. Octal numbers are supported, for convenience of the umask
options. To specify an octal number, use 0 as the first digit of the number.

.TP
.B accept_timeout
The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to establish connection with
a PASV style data connection.

Default: 60
.TP
.B anon_max_rate
The maximum data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second, for anonymous
clients.

Default: 0 (unlimited)
.TP
.B anon_umask
The value that the umask for file creation is set to for anonymous users. NOTE! If you want to specify octal values, remember the "0" prefix otherwise the
value will be treated as a base 10 integer!

Default: 077
.TP
.B connect_timeout
The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to respond to our PORT style
data connection.

Default: 60
.TP
.B data_connection_timeout
The timeout, in seconds, which is roughly the maximum time we permit data
transfers to stall for with no progress. If the timeout triggers, the remote
client is kicked off.

Default: 300
.TP
.B file_open_mode
The permissions with which uploaded files are created. Umasks are applied
on top of this value. You may wish to change to 0777 if you want uploaded
files to be executable.

Default: 0666
.TP
.B ftp_data_port
The port from which PORT style connections originate (as long as the poorly
named
.BR connect_from_port_20
is enabled).

Default: 20
.TP
.B idle_session_timeout
The timeout, in seconds, which is the maximum time a remote client may spend
between FTP commands. If the timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked
off.

Default: 300
.TP
.B listen_port
If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the port it will listen on for
incoming FTP connections.

Default: 21
.TP
.B local_max_rate
The maximum data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second, for local
authenticated users.

Default: 0 (unlimited)
.TP
.B local_umask
The value that the umask for file creation is set to for local users. NOTE! If
you want to specify octal values, remember the "0" prefix otherwise the value
will be treated as a base 10 integer!

Default: 077
.TP
.B max_clients
If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the maximum number of clients which
may be connected. Any additional clients connecting will get an error message.

Default: 0 (unlimited)
.TP
.B max_per_ip
If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the maximum number of clients which
may be connected from the same source internet address. A client will get an
error message if they go over this limit.

Default: 0 (unlimited)
.TP
.B pasv_max_port
The maximum port to allocate for PASV style data connections. Can be used to
specify a narrow port range to assist firewalling.

Default: 0 (use any port)
.TP
.B pasv_min_port
The minimum port to allocate for PASV style data connections. Can be used to
specify a narrow port range to assist firewalling.

Default: 0 (use any port)

.SH STRING OPTIONS
Below is a list of string options.

.TP
.B anon_root
This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into
after an anonymous login. Failure is silently ignored.

Default: (none)
.TP
.B banned_email_file
This option is the name of a file containing a list of anonymous e-mail
passwords which are not permitted. This file is consulted if the option
.BR deny_email_enable
is enabled.

Default: /etc/vsftpd.banned_emails
.TP
.B banner_file
This option is the name of a file containing text to display when someone
connects to the server. If set, it overrides the banner string provided by
the
.BR ftpd_banner
option.

Default: (none)
.TP
.B chown_username
This is the name of the user who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded
files. This option is only relevant if another option,
.BR chown_uploads ,
is set.

Default: root
.TP
.B chroot_list_file
The option is the name of a file containing a list of local users which
will be placed in a chroot() jail in their home directory. This option is
only relevant if the option
.BR chroot_list_enable
is enabled, and the option
.BR chroot_local_user
is disabled.

Default: /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list
.TP
.B guest_username
See the boolean setting
.BR guest_enable
for a description of what constitutes a guest login. This setting is the
real username which guest users are mapped to.

Default: ftp
.TP
.B ftp_username
This is the name of the user we use for handling anonymous FTP. The home
directory of this user is the root of the anonymous FTP area.

Default: ftp
.TP
.B ftpd_banner
This string option allows you to override the greeting banner displayed
by vsftpd when a connection first comes in.

Default: (none - default vsftpd banner is displayed)
.TP
.B listen_address
If vsftpd is in standalone mode, the default listen address (of all local
interfaces) may be overridden by this setting. Provide a numeric IP address.

Default: (none)
.TP
.B local_root
This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into
after a local (i.e. non-anonymous) login. Failure is silently ignored.

Default: (none)
.TP
.B message_file
This option is the name of the file we look for when a new directory is
entered. The contents are displayed to the remote user. This option is
only relevant if the option
.BR dirmessage_enable
is enabled.

Default: .message
.TP
.B nopriv_user
This is the name of the user that is used by vsftpd when it want to be
totally unprivileged. Note that this should be a dedicated user, rather
than nobody. The user nobody tends to be used for rather a lot of important
things on most machines.

Default: nobody
.TP
.B pam_service_name
This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.

Default: ftp
.TP
.B pasv_address
Use this option to override the IP address that vsftpd will advertise in
response to the PASV command. Provide a numeric IP address.

Default: (none - the address is taken from the incoming connected socket)
.TP
.B secure_chroot_dir
This option should be the name of a directory which is empty. Also, the
directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used
as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require filesystem access.

Default: /usr/share/empty
.TP
.B user_config_dir
This powerful option allows the override of any config option specified in
the manual page, on a per-user basis. Usage is simple, and is best illustrated
with an example. If you set
.BR user_config_dir
to be
.BR /etc/vsftpd_user_conf
and then log on as the user "chris", then vsftpd will apply the settings in
the file
.BR /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/chris
for the duration of the session. The format of this file is as detailed in
this manual page!

Default: (none)
.TP
.B userlist_file
This option is the name of the file loaded when the
.BR userlist_enable
option is active.

Default: /etc/vsftpd.user_list
.TP
.B xferlog_file
This option is the name of the file to which we write the transfer log. The
transfer log is only written if the option
.BR xferlog_enable
is set.

Default: /var/log/vsftpd.log
